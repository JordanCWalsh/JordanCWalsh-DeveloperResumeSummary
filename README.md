"I am passionate about acquiring new programming skills.  I am energized to design, develop and contribute to world-changing software projects.  I am detail oriented yet still a creative thinker.  I am a man of family, hard-work, long-term perspective, positive enthusiasm, faith & integrity.  At the end of the day, I work-to-live not live-to-work."â€‹
